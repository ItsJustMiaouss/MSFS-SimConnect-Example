# MSFS SimConnect Example

This repository is an example of how you can deal with the SimConnect SDK for Microsoft Flight Simulator.

This project was make with the Qt Framework for C++.

## Project Example

</div>

## Releases Example

I have built a Windows (x64) version of the software as an example. You can download it in the 'releases' section.

I used ``MinGW 11.2.0 64-bits`` for the compilation:

```bash
$ windeployqt msfs_simconnect_example.exe --no-translations --no-opengl-sw
```

## Development dependencies

Make sure you have installed the MSFS SDK!
